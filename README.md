## Employee Management Web Application

### Problem
A company needs an employee management system that is accessible to its employees both onsite and remotely. The system needs to be be able to hold employee information and track employee work hours and rates. Employees need to have different access rights depending on their position. Payment will not be handled by the employee management system.

### Solution
An employee management system will be created which contains employee accounts. Employee accounts can be logged into and all employees are able to edit personal information such as address. Accounts have roles which determine their access rights such as viewing other employees or editting wage rates. The system will have clock in and clock out features for shift based employees and log their work hours. The system will contain wages and salary information and calculate the appropriate pay. However, the system will not issue payments. Reports can be generated and exported.
